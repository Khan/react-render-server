To log into an ssh container running an instance, do something like
this:

- ssh to the machine via a page like
     https://console.developers.google.com/appengine/instances?project=khan-academy&moduleId=react-render
- run `sudo docker ps` to find the container running google-fluentd, the logging agent
- run `container_exec <name of container> /bin/bash`
- cd'd to /var/log/saved_docker
- cd'd to the only directory there (whose name was a 64-char string of hex characters)
- you can look at <really-long-name>-json.log (you could parse this file to look for all entries with the "stream" attribute set to "stdout", "stderr", etc.)
- you can also look at /var/log/nginx/access.log

To copy fixtures files to an existing instance:

- find javascript -name '*\.fixture\.*' | xargs tar cf /tmp/fixtures.tar
- gcloud compute instances list
  * find an instance for an old vesion we're no longer using
  * Also note the zone it's in, we'll need it for later.
- gcloud preview app modules set-managed-by react-render --version <version> --self
  * you can get the version from the instance name, just turn '--' into '-'
- cat /tmp/fixtures.tar | gcloud compute --project "khan-academy" ssh <instance> --zone <zone> --command 'cat > fixtures.tar'
- gcloud compute --project "khan-academy" ssh <instance> --zone <zone>
- CONTAINER_ID=`sudo docker ps | grep npm | awk '{print $1}'`
- sudo docker cp fixtures.tar ${CONTAINER_ID}:/app/fixtures.tar
- container_exec $CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
- cd app
- tar xf fixtures.tar
- export PATH=/nodejs/bin:$PATH
- Bob's your uncle!
